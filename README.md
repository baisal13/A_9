# 3D Shape Modeling - Python Project

This project demonstrates abstraction in Python by creating 3D shape classes using an abstract base class.

## Project Structure
- `Shape3D` — Abstract base class for 3D shapes.
- `Cube`, `Sphere`, `Cylinder` — Concrete classes implementing `surface_area()` and `volume()`.
- `random_shape()` — Generates random shapes with random dimensions.
- `main()` — Creates and displays a list of random shapes.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Open the project in PyCharm (or any editor).
3. Run the `shapes.py` file.

You will see randomly generated shapes with their surface area and volume.
